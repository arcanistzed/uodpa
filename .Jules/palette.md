## 2026-08-17 - [Skip-to-content Layout Enhancements]
**Learning:** Implementing skip-to-content links often requires pairing them with a proper semantic `<main>` tag that has `tabindex="-1"` and `outline-none` so focus skips down securely without leaving confusing focus rings.
**Action:** Ensure all site wrappers have skip-to-content logic utilizing this `<main>` pairing rather than just skipping to generic `id` anchors.

## 2026-08-17 - [Unicode Symbol Accessibility]
**Learning:** Screen readers often read decorative unicode symbols (like ♥) literally (e.g., "black heart suit"), which can be confusing in context.
**Action:** Always wrap decorative or inline unicode symbols in a `<span role="img" aria-label="[description]">` to ensure proper screen reader accessibility instead of them being read literally.

## 2023-10-27 - Added active state to navigation links
**Learning:** The navigation menu previously lacked any visual or semantic indication of the current active page, violating WCAG principles for providing context and hindering general usability for sighted users.
**Action:** Implemented dynamic path checking to apply `aria-current="page"` to the active link. This allowed for semantic indication for screen readers and styling using Tailwind's `aria-[current=page]:` variant to provide clear visual feedback without custom CSS.

## 2023-10-27 - Focus Management for Custom Details/Summary UI
**Learning:** When using `<details>` and `<summary>` for custom UI components (like a mobile menu or modal) that intercept standard browser behavior (e.g., closing via the Escape key), focus must be explicitly managed. If the menu is closed via keyboard without returning focus, keyboard users lose their place in the document flow.
**Action:** When programmatically closing a custom UI component via keyboard interaction (such as the Escape key), always return focus to the trigger element (e.g., the `<summary>` element) using `element.focus()`.
