## 2023-10-27 - Added active state to navigation links
**Learning:** The navigation menu previously lacked any visual or semantic indication of the current active page, violating WCAG principles for providing context and hindering general usability for sighted users.
**Action:** Implemented dynamic path checking to apply `aria-current="page"` to the active link. This allowed for semantic indication for screen readers and styling using Tailwind's `aria-[current=page]:` variant to provide clear visual feedback without custom CSS.
